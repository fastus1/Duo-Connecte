**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-31
**Phases:** 4
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

Reparer le systeme de tickets support pour que l'admin recoive les notifications et voie les tickets dans le dashboard.

## Phases

### Phase 4: Support Ticket Fixes

**Goal**: Admin can receive, view, and respond to support tickets
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (v1 complete)
**Requirements**: TICK-01, TICK-02, TICK-03
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Fix API route paths and configure email

**Success Criteria (achieved):**
1. User submits a support ticket and it appears in admin dashboard at `/admin`
2. Admin receives email notification when a new ticket is created
3. Admin can view ticket details in the dashboard
4. Admin can send email reply to user from the dashboard

**Root Causes Fixed:**
- Route mismatch: Frontend called `/api/admin/support/tickets` but backend exposed `/api/support/admin/tickets`
- Email: `RESEND_API_KEY` configured in Railway
- Railway cache: Added `nixpacks.toml` to ensure frontend rebuild
